# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that affects the retina and can lead to blindness if not detected early. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify retinal images into five severity levels of DR: No_DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative_DR.he model is trained on labeled retinal images and is deployed in a Flask-based web application, allowing users to upload images and get predictions. The goal is to assist ophthalmologists in early diagnosis and improve healthcare accessibility. The system provides faster, more accurate screening, aiding in timely intervention.
